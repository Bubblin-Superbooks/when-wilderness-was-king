The Dead March played for Dearborn's men just marching out of life;  
The swooping of the savage cloud that burst upon the rank  
And struck it with its thunderbolt in forehead and in flank,  
The spatter of the musket-shot, the rifles' whistling rain,—  
The sandhills drift round hope forlorn that never marched again."</pre><p>– <em>Benjamin F. Taylor.</em></p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
